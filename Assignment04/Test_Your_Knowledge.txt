1. Describe the problem generics address.
    - Generics allows programmers to minimize repeatence of code while
    allowing for good type safety and prevent unwanted boxing 

2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
    - List<string> list = new List<>(string);

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
    - Dictionary class can have up to two generic type parameters, one for key and one for value.
    if we want key and value to be same type we would use same T, otherwise we would mention two different types.

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
    - False
5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
    - Add() method.
    
6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
    - Remove(item), RemoveAt(index)
7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
    - you indicate that a class has a generic type parameters by writing <T> at the end of the class name
    
8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
    - False
9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
    - True
10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
    - True
